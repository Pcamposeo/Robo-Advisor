    "## 1. DATA CLEANING: \n",
    "\n",
    "This cell is where the data cleaning happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE GOAL:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIgnore any tickers that do not reference a valid stock denominated in USD, i.e., only use US listed stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tUse only tickers that reference stocks which have an average monthly volume of at least 200,000 shares, as calculated based on the time interval of January 01, 2022 to October 31, 2022. A month is defined as a calendar month. We will drop any month that does not have at least 20 trading days.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE PROCESS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we have chosen to implement multithreading, in order to speed up the process. The data cleaning is the most time-consuming code in the program to run. Due to this, we have two main functions (currency_check and volume_check), running on two seperate threads, c and v. Rigorous testing done by our group has shown that the currency check is the most time-consuming function, taking around 4-12 minutes (with a sample size of 62 tickers) (as opposed to volume_check, which takes 1-2 minutes) depending on the system on which the code is being run, as well as other (seemingly random) factors. Most of that time is spent retrieving .info information from each respective ticker. As there is no other (trusted) way to do this, we hypothesize that this implementation is about as fast as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Queues to store appropriate variables, so that they can be retrieved later by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our code checks each of the two criterion mentioned (one for each function), and creates two lists. Each list contains tickers which reference stocks that have satisfied the criteria of the functions. As we want stocks that fit both criterion, our final list of (valid) tickers is the set intersection of the two lists which each function produces.\n"
