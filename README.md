# CFM-101-Final-Assignment
Hey! This is our final assignment for CFM 101! Enjoy.

Please note that all members made significant contributions. You may notice that Piero made most of the commits, however this was due to technical issues. Often members communicated their changes to Piero, who then changed the file and pushed them.
